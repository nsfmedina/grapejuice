# Grapejuice
Lots of grapes. Lots of juices. A gulp-based, ES6 powered-up workflow for quick-starting apps.

## What?
Basically, it is a workflow made with Gulp and Node.JS for building pages, optimizing development process and integrations that depend on basic Frontend tasks. (Such as building interfaces, landing pages, using Sass and Browserify).

## How do I use it?
You need to have **Node, NPM and Gulp** already installed on your environment.
After having those installed, install the workflow's dependencies.
```npm install```
Then, run the workflow task process with the command ```gulp```.
